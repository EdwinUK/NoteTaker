# NoteTaker
This application can be used to take down simple notes, each note has a title and content. These notes are stored in an SQL database which can be simply connected using a connection string, from there a database handler class will communicate with the database using parameterized queries. A modern GUI has also been developed using a windows form to ensure easy accessibility for any user.


The purpose of this application was to provide me with some C# programming experience, this is my first ever application written in C#.
